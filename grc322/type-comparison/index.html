				<h2>History of Each Typeface</h2>

				<h3>DIN</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
				<p>DIN was first commissioned in 1931 by the Deutsches Institut für Normung (German Institute for Standardization) in Germany to create a unified lettering system for public administration, transportation, and engineering during a period of industrial standardization. Its geometric, sans serif forms, minimal strokes, and clear structure reflected functionalist design ideals and ensured quick legibility; by 1936 it was widely used on German signage. The typeface was later updated by URW Type Foundry in Hamburg, and expanded in 1995 by Dutch designer Albert-Jan Pool with FF DIN for contemporary use. A 2017 rendition by Volker Schnebel further developed the family, now used by brands such as Forever 21 and DirecTV.</p>
			
				<h3>Interstate</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->
				<p>Interstate was designed by Tobias Frere-Jones in the United States between 1993 and 1999, drawing inspiration from Highway Gothic, the signage alphabets created in 1949 for the Federal Highway Administration during the expansion of the Eisenhower-era interstate highway system. Rooted in mid-century American infrastructure and modernist clarity, Interstate reinterpreted these utilitarian forms for the corporate design landscape of the 1990s. Its sans serif structure features geometric shapes, wide spacing, large open counters, and sharply slanted terminals, offering versatility across many weights and styles. The typeface became popular for branding and display, used by companies such as Citigroup, Southwest Airlines, SoundCloud, and Lamborghini.</p>

						
				<h2>Comparison</h2>

				<h3>Similarities</h3>

				<figure>
					<img src="images/Pentagram comparison.svg"
							alt="Comparison of the letters H, x, p, t, y and the ascender line, cap line, x-height, baseline, and the descender line in DIN and Interstate.">
					<figcaption>Interstate and DIN may look like similar typefaces at a distance, but up close they are very different typefaces. Still, the serif typefaces do share some similarities. Both of them have lots of fonts that vary in weight and style. Above, both of them are in a regular style. For more straightforward characters with sharp angles, they have almost the same shape with some variation.</figcaption>
				</figure>
					
				<figure>
					<img src="images/TC CapKL.svg"
							alt="Comparison showcasing the similarities in an uppercase K in DIN and an uppercase K in Interstates.">
					<figcaption>Above is the Uppercase K, very simple and sharp-angled character. There is a slight variation in the thickness of the K. This was one of the most similar character between the two typefaces, the rest have too big of a difference to compare with transparency.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<figure>
					<img src="images/TC CapL.svg"
							alt="Comparison showcasing the similarities in an uppercase L in DIN and an uppercase L in Interstate.">
					<figcaption>Above is the Uppercase L, which is also a very simple and sharp-angled character. There is a slight variation in the thickness for the base for the L. Again, this was one of the most similar character between the two typefaces, the rest have too big of a difference to compare with transparency.</figcaption>

					<figcaption>The DIN descender of g has a smaller angle than the Interstate descender of g. The DIN loop of g is longer than the Interstate loop of g which is much shorter. The DIN counter of g is more symmetrical and longer than the Interstate counter of g which is much more round and shorter.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<figure>
					<img src="images/TC Lowi.svg"
							alt="Comparison of the tittles in lowercase i in DIN and a lowercase i in Interstate.">

				</figure>

				<figure>
					<img src="images/TC Lowl.svg"
							alt="Comparison of the terminals the lowercase l in DIN and a lowercase l in Interstate.">
